All components have been successfully transformed to the blue and white theme. The entire website now uses a consistent color palette with:
- Blue (500-900) as primary colors

- White and light blue (50-100) for backgrounds
- Blue gradients for all visual effects
- Semantic colors (green, red, amber) preserved for success/error/warning states

## Next Steps:

1. ✅ Test all components together in the browser
2. ✅ Verify visual consistency across all pages
3. ✅ Check color contrast for accessibility (WCAG compliance)
4. ✅ Test user interactions (hover states, clicks, animations)
5. ✅ Verify loading animations display correctly

## Notes:
- Keep success (green), error (red), and warning (amber) colors for semantic meaning
- All dark backgrounds changed to white/light blue
- All light text changed to dark blue
- All purple/violet/fuchsia gradients changed to blue/cyan
- Maintain glow effects but with blue colors
